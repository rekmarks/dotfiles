## Recovery

- First, install:
  - `homebrew` from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
    - `brew install yarn`
  - Oh My ZSH!
    - `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
  - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- Then, attempt automatic reinstall:
  - `yarn install:fresh`
  - If the script fails, see contents for manual steps.
- Finally:
  - In a running instance of `nvim`
    - `:PlugInstall`
    - `:so ~/.vimrc` or restart `nvim`
  - GPG signing
    - Download [GPG Tools](https://gpgtools.org/)
    - If you were smart and saved your GPG key, you can reuse it.
    - Whatever the case, follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification).

### Gotchas

- `pyenv`
  - Check that the desired versions are listed in `scripts/install/install_python.sh`
  - Sometimes after updating, you have to run `pyenv rehash` to properly update PATH
